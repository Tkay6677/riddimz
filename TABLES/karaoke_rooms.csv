[00:13.06]
[00:15.69]I found a love for me
[00:28.21]Darling just dive right in
[00:31.34]And follow my lead
[00:35.52]Well I found a girl beautiful and sweetÂ 
[00:42.84]I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
[00:50.15]'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
[00:54.33]
[00:54.85]Not knowing what it was
[00:58.54]I will not give you up this time
[01:05.82]But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
[01:14.18]And in your eyes you're holding mine
[01:19.41]
[01:20.45]Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
[01:30.90]Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
[01:38.74]When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
[01:46.57]But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
[01:54.41]
[01:59.14]Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
[02:06.74]She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
[02:14.26]I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
[02:22.62]To carry love, to carry children of our own
[02:28.37]We are still kids, but we're so in love
[02:33.39]Fighting against all odds
[02:37.28]I know we'll be alright this time
[02:44.59]Darling, just hold my hand
[02:48.22]Be my girl, I'll be your man
[02:52.43]I see my future in your eyes
[02:58.18]
[02:58.70]Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
[03:09.64]Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
[03:16.96]When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
[03:23.75]I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
[03:33.15]
[03:44.15]Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
[03:55.12]Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
[04:02.96]I have faith in what I see
[04:06.09]Now I know I have met an angel in person
[04:12.34]And she looks perfect
[04:16.00]I don't deserve this
[04:20.17]You look perfect tonight
